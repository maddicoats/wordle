# Wordle Project

A java game based on Wordle to be played in the eclipse console.

## MVP

- Recreate a simplified version of the game Wordle to be played in a Java console application
- The game should be able to randomly select a 5-letter word from the provided word list
- The user will be able to enter a guess word that is also 5 characters long
- For each letter, the application will tell the user if that letter is correct, right letter in the wrong position, or wrong letter
- After the user guesses 6 times incorrectly, the game is over and the user loses
- If the user guesses the word correctly, the game is over and the user wins
- In addition you must implement one of the following extensions, or an extension of your own design as approved by a coach

### Extension

- Create a history file that keeps track of user wins/losses and how many letters they guessed it in
